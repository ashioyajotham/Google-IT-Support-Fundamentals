//Our CPU doesn't know that there is a device that it can talk to, so it has to connect to something called the BIOS, or basic input output services. 
//The BIOS is software that helps initialize the hardware in our computer and gets our operating system up and running.

//How computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working correctly. This is called a Power On Self Test or POST.
//CMOS battery stores BIOS settings
