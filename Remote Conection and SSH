       ## SSH

// A protocol implemented by other programs to securely access one computer from another eg Putty
Syntax: ssh user@ipaddress

// You can also connect remotely to your computer through VPN

##### Remote connections on Windows (https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/lecture/Aw8Nh/remote-connections-on-windows)
// Default port is 22 for SSH
// On Windows Powershell: putty.exe -ssh@ipaddress
// Microsoft actually provides another way to connect to other Windows computers called the 
   Remote Desktop Protocol or RDP provided the remote computer has enabled incoming RDP connections. 
   They're also RDP clients for Linux and OS X too like real VNC and Microsoft RDP on Mac. 
// A client program called the Microsoft terminal services client or mstsc.exe is used to create RDP connections to remote computers.
